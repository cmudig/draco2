**Work in Progress**

Draco is a formal framework for representing design knowledge about effective visualization design as a collection of
constraints. You can use Draco to find effective visualization designs or validate existing ones. Draco's constraints
are based on Answer Set Programming (ASP) and solved with the [Clingo](https://github.com/potassco/clingo) constraint
solver. We also implemented a way to learn weights for the recommendation system directly from the results of graphical
perception experiment. Draco v2 is a much improved version of the first iteration of
[Draco](https://github.com/uwdata/draco).

## Documentation

Read about Draco in the online book at [https://dig.cmu.edu/draco2/](https://dig.cmu.edu/draco2/) or launch it in
interactive mode using [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/cmudig/draco2/HEAD). In the documentation, we just refer to
_Draco_ without a version.

## What's different from [Draco v1](https://github.com/uwdata/draco)?

- Draco v2 is completely written in Python. No more need to run both Python and Node. We still use ASP for the knowledge
  base.
- Generalized and extended chart specification format. The new format is more extensible with custom properties.
- Support for multiple views and view composition.
- High test-coverage, documentation, and updated development tooling.
