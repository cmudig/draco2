# Overview

To express knowledge about visualizations, we need a language to describe visualizations. A visualization is described as a set of facts. In this section, we will describe the language we have chosen for Draco. The Draco description language describes visualizations as encodings. The language also describes the context of a visualization (e.g. properties of the data and task).

```{note}
You could design your own description language and use it with Draco or extend the existing language we use here.
