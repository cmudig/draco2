# Marks

The mark represents the graphical mark of the visualization. Draco uses an encoding based on the Grammar of Graphics
(GoG) {cite}`wilkinson2012grammar`. In the GoG, marks are described as Geometric objects ("geoms" for short). We use the
term mark as that's the term Vega-Lite {cite}`satyanarayan2016vega` uses.

Marks have [encodings](encoding.md), which define how data fields map to the mark's visual properties.

If a view has multiple marks, Draco assumes that the marks are layered (i.e. they are in the same view space in the
chart).

## Mark Properties

`(mark,type)` : The mark type. One of `point`, `bar`, `line`, `area`, `text`, `tick`, or `rect`.

## Example

```prolog
entity(view,root,v).

entity(mark,v,m).
attribute((mark,type),m,tick).
entity(encoding,m,e).
```
